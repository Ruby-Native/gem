    # 1. A `data-native-presentation` element, reported with every other signal
    #    once the page has rendered. This is what Normal Mode reads, and Normal
    #    Mode can act on it late: it has no push stack, so suppressing back is
    #    not a navigation and nothing refetches.
    #
    # 2. A `Native-Presentation` response header. Advanced Mode has to decide
    #    before the navigation commits, or it pushes and then visibly corrects
    #    itself. On a form submission Turbo has already fetched the destination
    #    by the time it proposes the visit, so the header is readable at
    #    `turbo:before-fetch-response` — before the proposal — and the header is
    #    the only part of that response readable synchronously, since the body
    #    arrives as a promise that consuming would take from Turbo.
    #
    # Nothing is declared at the origin. Both channels ride the response for the
    # page itself, so a redirect chain carries the intent to wherever it actually
    # lands rather than to wherever the link pointed.
    #
    # In Advanced Mode this takes effect before the navigation commits when the
    # page arrives from a form submission, because that is the only case where
    # Turbo has already fetched the destination by the time it proposes the
    # visit. A link tap, a deep link and a cold boot are proposed before anything
    # is fetched, so those fall back to the element and the shell corrects after
    # the page renders. Normal Mode always uses the element.
